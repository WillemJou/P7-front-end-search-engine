# Recipes Search Engine 🥧 🫑 🍍🍕

Recipes Search Engine is a little PWA from my training. Writing in pure JS, it allows you to search some cooking recipes from a local database.

## Installation

Just have to clone the repo (no dependencies).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WillemJou/P7-front-end-search-engine.git
```
